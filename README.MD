## How to play

Move along your horizon, blasting enemies as they encroach, don't let any of them hit your horizon, and don't get shot!

Accuracy is key to a high score, missing enemies will reset your chain and lower your scoring potential.


## Caring is sharing
Horizon Shift 64 was a fun hobby project for me over the Christmas period, so if you enjoy my little game, please feel free to share, hack and crack away! 

Thanks to anyone who takes the time to play my little game, I hope you enjoy it :)
